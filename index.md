Hardware Acceleration for Machine Learning (B18) - Rajesh Gupta

1. The most interesting topic I have covered in my domain thus far has been the vivado implmementations of code on FPGAs.  It reminds me of the reason I got into programming in the first place, working with logic gates to solve problems.
2. In Quarter 2 I would like to pursue our continued work on developing a fast multiplication algorithm for matrix multiplication which we can run on an FPGA.
3. I would like to work more with hardware in quarter 2, as right now most of my work is still simulated.
4. The dream goal of this project would be to get this core installed on a custom chip as opposed to running on an FPGA.
